# Insomnia template tag for Truepic Webhook Signatures

For the nice rest client [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest).

Install by going to the plugins tab in Insomnia and search for `insomia-plugin-truepic-webhook-signature` or go to https://insomnia.rest/plugins/insomia-plugin-truepic-webhook-signature and click the Install Plugin button.

The main feature is being able to generate a truepic like HMAC signatures using the request body, the timestamp of the request, and a secret key. The signature is generated using the [HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC) algorithm and the [SHA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) hash function.

## Truepic Webhook Signatures

The `truepic-signature` header looks like this:

```
truepic-signature: t=1634066973,s=6FBEiVZ8EO79dk5XllfnG18b83ZvLt2kdxcE8FJ/BwU
```

there’s a t value that’s the timestamp of when the request was sent in seconds, and an s value that’s the signature of the
request. That signature is generated by taking the request body, the timestamp, and the secret key, and then hashing it using
the HMAC algorithm.

## Examples

Add the tag by pushing `Ctrl + Space` and search for `Truepic Webhook Signature`, you will see several variants for the different hash functions used.
